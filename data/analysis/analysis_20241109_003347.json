The image shows a man sitting in front of a computer screen with a lamp on the desk.\n\nSince there is no fire visible in the image, I cannot provide the requested information about fire severity, estimated fire spread direction, potential risks to nearby areas, or recommended immediate actions. If you could provide a different image that shows a fire, I would be happy to assist you with your request.",
